* Create a Flux to manage the purchase order and apply offer based on the category

* Assumptions

    - product should have name, price, category
    - the fluxA should emit random product
    - we consider allowed categories 'Kids' and 'Automotive'.
    - the fluxB based on the category should take different action:
        1. if category is not allowed, then drop the item
        2. if category is Kids then apply 50% discount on the price and add a random item for free
        3. if the category is Automotive, then add 10% tax on the price

* Expectations

    - should be possible to check the revenue for the allowed categories
